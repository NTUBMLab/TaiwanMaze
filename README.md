# Virtual Environments

## Stimuli
- Photographs are captured around Taipei Main Station, consisting of 55 shops, 34 walls with windows, 60 walls with doors, and 1 sidewalk pavement.
- Photographs are pasted on 3x3x3 cubic meter blank cubes to create unit buildings.
- Each virtual environment consists of 12 goal shops, 102 plain buildings, 80 roads, and 4 obstacles.
- Twelve salient goal shops are marked with eye-catching billboards.
- Screenshots of the virtual environments are captured at 1.5-m height and 120-degree field of view spaced by 6-meter distances and 45-degree orientations.
- Extra screenshots of the salient goal shops are captured with 22.5-degree orientations for direction judgment sessions during tasks.

## Mazes
- MapA and MapB are two different virtual environments with twelve distinct goal shops.
- MapA and MapB are built in a 72x72 meter square environment using 24x24 unit buildings.
- MapA and MapB are built controlling the same size and the number of the blocks, similar number of junctions, the same number of between-goal paths, similar between-goal distances, and the same non-goal surroundings.
